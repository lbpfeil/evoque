<objective>
Fix badge contrast, deck table text size, and Settings page width

Purpose: Improve visual accessibility and readability across three components
Output: Three components with improved styling - badge is readable, deck titles are legible, Settings has reasonable width

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix badge contrast (FIX-01)</name>
  <files>components/StudyStatusBadge.tsx</files>
  <action>
In StudyStatusBadge.tsx, find the "new" status badge (the yellow one for "Aprendendo").

Current classes use yellow colors with low contrast:
- `bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 text-yellow-700 dark:text-yellow-300`
- `border-yellow-100 dark:border-yellow-800/50`

Replace with amber colors for better contrast:
- `bg-amber-100 dark:bg-amber-900/30 text-amber-900 dark:text-amber-200`
- `border-amber-200 dark:border-amber-700/50`

This maintains the yellow family while providing adequate contrast ratio (4.5:1+) for accessibility.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run dev` and navigate to Study page. Find a book with status "Aprendendo" (new cards). Verify:
1. Badge text is clearly readable in light mode
2. Badge text is clearly readable in dark mode (toggle with theme button)
3. Badge still looks visually distinct from blue (learning) and green (review) badges
  </verify>
  <done>FIX-01 complete: Badge "Aprendendo" has adequate contrast in both themes</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Increase deck table text size (FIX-02)</name>
  <files>components/DeckTable.tsx</files>
  <action>
In DeckTable.tsx, find the book title and author text elements.

The research indicates lines 48-57 use `sm:text-caption` (12px on desktop) which is too small.

Find patterns like:
```tsx
"text-body sm:text-caption text-foreground truncate"
```

Remove the `sm:text-caption` responsive override so `text-body` (14px) applies at all breakpoints:
```tsx
"text-body text-foreground truncate"
```

Apply this change to both the title and author text elements. The text should be 14px (text-body) on all screen sizes.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run dev` and navigate to Study page. View the deck table. Verify:
1. Book titles are clearly readable (14px, not 12px)
2. Author names are clearly readable
3. Mobile layout still works (no overflow issues)
  </verify>
  <done>FIX-02 complete: Deck table titles and authors are legible at 14px</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add max-width to Settings page (FIX-07)</name>
  <files>pages/Settings.tsx</files>
  <action>
In Settings.tsx, find the main content container (research indicates line 284-285).

Current structure is likely:
```tsx
<div className="p-lg">
```

Add a max-width constraint to prevent the page from stretching too wide on large monitors:
```tsx
<div className="p-lg max-w-2xl">
```

The `max-w-2xl` (672px) provides a comfortable reading width. If the Settings page has nested sections that also need constraining, apply the max-width at the appropriate level to maintain proper padding.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run dev` and navigate to Settings page. Resize browser to a wide viewport (1920px+). Verify:
1. Settings content does not stretch full width
2. Content is constrained to a reasonable reading width
3. All tabs (Import, Library, Account, Preferences) respect the max-width
  </verify>
  <done>FIX-07 complete: Settings page has reasonable max-width on wide screens</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After all tasks complete:
1. `npm run build` succeeds without errors
2. Badge contrast is visually confirmed in both themes
3. Deck table text is legible
4. Settings page has max-width constraint
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- FIX-01: Badge "Aprendendo" readable in light and dark modes
- FIX-02: Book titles in Study deck table are 14px
- FIX-07: Settings page content constrained to max-w-2xl
- No visual regressions in other components
</success_criteria>
